#Lab 38
When a new task is created within a team, alert all users who are a part of that team about that new task.

There are several steps involved in allowing this to work:

Store which team a user is part of in the cloud
Add a Lambda trigger on task creation
Use SNS to send a notification as part of that Lambda
